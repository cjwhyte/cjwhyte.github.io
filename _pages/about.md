Hi! I'm Christopher. 

I’m a theoretical neuroscientist and postdoctoral researcher in the Adaptive Dynamical Systems group at the University of Sydney. 

I originally trained as a cognitive scientist, but somewhere along the way, I came down with a terrible case of physics envy and decided to retrain as a theoretician and computational modeller. I now work at the intersection of neurobiology, psychology, and applied mathematics using tools from nonlinear dynamics and machine learning to build and analyse neurobiologically informed models of elemental cognitive and biological functions such as decision making, perceptual awareness, and the global state of consciousness (e.g. wake, sleep, anaesthesia).
